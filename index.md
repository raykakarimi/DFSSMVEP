## About DF-SSmVEP

In this paper, we focus on the design of a novel SSmVEP paradigm without using resources such as trial time, phase, and/or number of targets to enhance the ITR. The proposed design is based on the intuitively pleasing idea of integrating more than one motion within a single SSmVEP target stimuli, simultaneously.

To elicit SSmVEP, we designed a novel and innovative dual frequency aggregated modulation paradigm, referred to as the  Dual Frequency Aggregated steady-state motion Visual Evoked Potential (DF-SSmVEP), by concurrently integrating Radial Zoom and Rotation motions in a single target without increasing the trial length. Compared to conventional SSmVEPs, the proposed DF-SSmVEP framework consists of two motion modes integrated and shown simultaneously each modulated by a specific target frequency.

The paper also develops a specific unsupervised classification model, referred to as the Bifold  Canonical Correlation Analysis (BCCA), based on two motion frequencies per target. The corresponding covariance coefficients are utilized as extra features improving the classification accuracy. The proposed DF-SSmVEP is evaluated based on a real EEG dataset and the results corroborate its superiority.
